                <h2>Design Rationale and Justification</h2>
                <p>The visualization titled "Trace to Tomorrow: Unfolding the Trajectory of Waste Management" is designed to present an overview of waste management practices across different buildings over the years. The bar chart was chosen for its clarity and simplicity, which allow viewers to immediately grasp differences and trends in waste disposal methods among the buildings.I have explicitly mentioned this title in my visualization and included it to anchor the thematic focus and facilitate immediate recognition of the content's scope.</p>
                
                <h2>Choices of Visualization Type, Size, Color, and Other Visual Elements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visualization Type:</strong>A grouped bar chart was selected to compare three categories of waste management—Compost, Landfill, and Recycling—across multiple buildings. This type provides a clear differentiation between categories and enables quick comparison of each building's performance in waste management over a given year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Size:</strong> The chart is designed with ample width to ensure that each group of bars is distinct and legible, avoiding overcrowding despite the presence of multiple buildings and categories. This helps in quickly identifying trends without confusion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color:</strong>Each waste management stream is represented by a different color—orange for Compost, green for Recycling, and blue for Landfill. These colors were chosen for their strong contrast with each other, enhancing the chart's readability and allowing for quick visual differentiation between the waste streams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Elements:</strong>The inclusion of an interactive slider for the year allows users to explore data across different years without overwhelming them with information all at once. The 'Play/Pause' button further aids in automatic visualization of changes over time, making it engaging and informative</li>
                    <li><strong>Annotations:</strong>Strategic annotations, like the specific weight of waste in the Landfill category for 'Graham' in 2016, provide quick insights and highlight significant data points, enhancing understanding without cluttering the visual</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                <h3>Effectiveness of the Design</h3>
                <p>This design effectively delivers the story of how waste management practices have evolved across different buildings over the years. The use of distinct colors and clear labeling helps in quickly identifying which buildings are leading in recycling or reducing landfill waste. The interactive component not only makes the visualization engaging but also allows for a tailored exploration of the data based on the user's pace and preference.</p>
                <p>By presenting the data in this structured manner, stakeholders can identify best practices and areas needing improvement in waste management across the campus. This visualization not only informs but also empowers decision-making towards more sustainable practices.</p>
